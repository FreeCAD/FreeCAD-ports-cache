####
#   This travis configuration file is used to manage the FreeCAD osx ports cache.
#  
#   1.  The enviornment is initialized by creating a GitHub repo context that is used
#       by the travis-helpers functions.
#   2.  If a cache exists for the current FreeCAD release, it is downloaded and deployed
#   3.  If the local cache state is current (i.e. not outdated/stale), then the build exits
#       at this point.
#   4.  However if the local cache state is outdated or stale, then a new ports dependency cache
#       is built using homebrew under the default previx of /usr/local
#   5.  Once the cache is built, a compressed tar file of the ports is uploaded to GitHub for
#       use during Travis-CI builds.
#
#   NOTES:  a) If you fork this repo and would like to deploy a ports cache, be sure to define
#              a Travis-CI encrypted environment variable GH_TOKEN that contains the GitHub
#              OAUTH token needed to deploy a release asset to your forked repo.
#           b) If you want to force a cache rebuild, you can set the the environment variable
#              FORCE_CACHE_REBUILD=1 conveniently via the Travis CI Repo Settings UI
